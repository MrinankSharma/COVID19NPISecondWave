    "some quick notes: due to inconsistent data formatting (& sometimes just wrong dates), i'm currently not getting all the NPIs. i'm always getting around half in each country. Austra is almost perfect by default (go team Austria!). I spent a bit of time making exceptions to get 90% of UK NPIs. I haven't spent any time on making exceptions for Italy or Germany. Expect it to take at most a few hours to get 90+% of all NPIs. If you still plan to do a run tomorrow Mrinank, if you think it's worth it I can probably do a few hours of work in the morn to get up to 90%. lmk"
