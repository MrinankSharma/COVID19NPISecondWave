Netherlands ,Flevoland,NA,No,Na ,No limit on most public gatherings ,Before 01/08/2020,"Quote: ""250 people are allowed to gather in outdoor areas.
Staff does not count.
More than 250 people are allowed in places with fixed seats.
You reserve a spot.
And you will receive a health check.
This applies, for example, in the catering industry.
There is no maximum number of people at zoos and amusement parks."" Comment: As gatherings with fixed seats were allowed above 250 and this did not apply to zoos or amusement parks it is not possible to say that most public outdoor gatherings were limited in this period.

Netherlands ,Gelderland-South,NA,No,Na ,No limit on most public gatherings ,Before 01/08/2020,"Quote: ""250 people are allowed to gather in outdoor areas.
Staff does not count.
More than 250 people are allowed in places with fixed seats.
You reserve a spot.
And you will receive a health check.
This applies, for example, in the catering industry.
There is no maximum number of people at zoos and amusement parks."" Comment: As gatherings with fixed seats were allowed above 250 and this did not apply to zoos or amusement parks it is not possible to say that most public outdoor gatherings were limited in this period.
